   The MoleMarshal package is a collection of packages to automate
   the creation, uploading and management of subject sets to the MoleMarshal
   Zooniverse project.

   The `active_learning` sub-package is responsible for creating an "active
   learning" pipeline and mole classification model. The active learning model
   is designed to calculate and adjust the weighting of subjects in a subject set,
   which will enable stamps which the model is unsure of to show up preferentially
   in the Zooniverse workflow. The purpose of this approach is to optimize the time
   and effort medical professionals have to expend to classify stamp images.
