# Void Orchestra

*Void Orchestra* is a python package designed to create lightcurves of quasi-periodic oscillations,


## Requirements

### Package Manager 
**Void Orchestra** uses the Python package manager [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). 
This can easily be installed system-wide using `pipx`:

```bash
$ sudo apt install pipx  # Or if on RHEL, sudo yum install pipx
$ pipx install uv
```

### Plot Graphics
Plots are generated using the `plotly` Python package, which requires a working browser.
If using a server that doesn't have a browser by default, install **chromium**:
```bash
$ sudo apt install chromium  # 
```

### Environment Variables

A shell environment variable `VOIDORCHESTRA_CONFIG` is also required, 
which points to the configuration file which configures *Void Orchestra*,

```bash
$ export VOIDORCHESTRA_CONFIG="/path/to/config/file"
```

or if you use fish,

```bash
$ set -gx VOIDORCHESTRA_CONFIG "/path/to/config/file"
```

If this configuration file does not exist at this location, 
the default configuration file will be copied to this location.

## Installation

To install *Void Orchestra*, create a `/var/www` directory (if it doesn't already exist) and clone the repository there:

```bash
mkdir /var/www 
cd /var/www
git clone https://github.com/Southampton-RSG/voidorchestra.git 
```

Then, enter the directory, install the software and initialise the database, before installing the 'fixtures' containing
pre-set sonification methods and profiles:

```bash 
cd voidorchestra
make install
make database 
make fixtures
```

## Usage

Once the database has been installed and initialised, you can begin creating new sonifications.
